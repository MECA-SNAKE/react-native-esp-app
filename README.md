The snake control application is a feature-rich mobile app developed using React Native, a popular framework for building cross-platform applications. Written in TypeScript, a statically-typed superset of JavaScript, the code ensures code reliability through type checking.
The snake control application built using React Native allows users to control the snake's movements wirelessly. The application utilizes various components and libraries to create a user-friendly interface. The code is written in TypeScript, a statically-typed superset of JavaScript, which adds type checking and enhances code reliability. React Native simplifies the development process by allowing developers to write code in JavaScript or TypeScript and then translating it into native components for both iOS and Android platforms.

The code architecture of the application is based on functional components, a concept introduced in React that allows developers to write reusable UI (user interface) components as functions. React hooks, such as useState and useEffect, are used to manage the application's "state". For example, state variables like 'run', 'showGame' or 'isLeftPressed' keep track of the snake's or the application's state (whether the snake is moving, whether the game screen should be displayed or whether the snake is going left, respectively). These state variables are updated through event handlers (functions), such as handleButtonStartPress and handleLeft, which are triggered by user actions like button presses.

The ESP8266 allows us to send commands to it via WiFi, which we exploited in this app. To communicate with the snake device wirelessly, the application utilizes a library called axios. Axios facilitates HTTP requests and enables the application to send commands and receive data from the snake. For instance, the receiveRequests function periodically (setInterval(receiveRequests, 1000)) sends a GET request to check for holes in front of the snake, while the sendRequests function is responsible for sending control commands such as starting or stopping the snake's motion, adjusting parameters like wavelength and amplitude, and selecting different motion modes like concertina or undulated.

We tried to design the user interface of the application in a way that would enhance the user experience most. It includes sliders from the '@react-native-community/slider' package, which allow users to adjust parameters like wavelength, amplitude, and frequency by sliding the controls. The "game" mode of the application is designed in a way that most facilitates the user experience of controlling the snake. We used a "joystick" to allow the user to control the snake.

The app has taken various different faces throughout our project, initially, our goal was to be able to allow the user to enter any possible combination of parameters for the wavelength, amplitude, speed and frequency, but the more we tested out our snake's motion, we realized that random parameter inputs were not to the snake's advantage. We decided to abandon this idea to prevent the snake from making sudden movements and damaging itself. We have preconfigured parameter inputs to plug into the snake at any moment the user wants it to turn right, left, go forwards or backwards. It's important to note that the application doesn't allow the user to go left or right if the inchworm motion is enabled and doesn't allow the user to go anywhere but forwards if the concertina motion is enabled. This is because we have to flip the snake over when the inchworm motion is enabled, imposing only 1 degree of freedom on the vertical axis. 

Finally, with some solid background of computer science studies, we thought that React Native was a very straight-forward and intuitive framework to use for our snake project. By combining efficient state management, network communication, and intuitive user interface design, the application offers a seamless and engaging experience for controlling the snake wirelessly.
